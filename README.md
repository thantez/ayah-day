# Introduction

Muslims have a holy book called the Qur'an, whose language is Arabic and whose Persian translation is available.

So, I had an idea to writing a program that would show me a verse from this book with a translation and a `Tafsir` (Interpretation)  in texts and sounds, every day when I turn on the computer.

# Description

This is a simple implementation. :))

# installation

[install Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)

clone this repo.

then:

```bash
cd ayah-day
mix deps.get
mix compile
mix scenic.run
```
